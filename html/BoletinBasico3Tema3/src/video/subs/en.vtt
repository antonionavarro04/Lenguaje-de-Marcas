00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:04.000
Next up is where we introduce the entertainment industry's sparkling gemstones

00:00:4.000 --> 00:00:5.000
Uncovering

00:00:05.500 --> 00:00:09.000
This morning is the artist who became a popular topic due to his high toned voice

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.500
Let's pay attention to his singing together

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:17.000
♫ We watched fireworks blooming in a flash of light ♫

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:22.000
♫ Surely this summer is far from over ♫

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.000
The person singing the currently popular song <<FIREWORKS>>

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.000
Is not DAOKO-san, but a male singer

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:30.000
Futhermore,

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:35.000
♫ What happens if my thoughts for you overflows? ♫

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:39.500
♫ When is the right moment or right time ♫

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:47.700
♫ To hold your hand? ♫

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.000
He is the one with the fresh crsip voice, Mafumafu-san

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:55.000
His voice has no added autotune

00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:00.000
In this year's June, his singing was shown to the 35.000 people that attended his concert at Seibu Dome

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.000
♫ Won't you dance with me? ♫

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:06.000
♫ Ripples on the water that resound with sorrow ♫

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.500
♫ In the depths of the Yellow River ♫

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:12.200
- I really like him! I listen to his songs everyday! -

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:15.200
- He can sing a high key that girls even sing up to -

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:18.500
- The fact that he can make those high notes is astonishing -

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:20.000
Mafumafu-san,

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:22.000
Is actually a very shy person

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:23.000
Mafumafu in a shy tone: I'm Mafu

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:28.000
Because he doesn't show his face,

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:30.000
He keeps his mask on even when we interviewed him
