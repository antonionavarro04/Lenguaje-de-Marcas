00:00:4.000 --> 00:00:5.000
Uncovering

00:00:05.500 --> 00:00:09.000
This morning is the artist who became a popular topic due to his high toned voice

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.500
Let's pay attention to his singing together

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:17.000
♫ We watched fireworks blooming in a flash of light ♫

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:22.000
♫ Surely this summer is far from over ♫

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.000
The person singing the currently popular song <<FIREWORKS>>

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.000
Is not DAOKO-san, but a male singer

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:30.000
Futhermore,

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:35.000
♫ What happens if my thoughts for you overflows? ♫

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:39.500
♫ When is the right moment or right time ♫

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:47.700
♫ To hold your hand? ♫

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.000
He is the one with the fresh crsip voice, Mafumafu-san

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:55.000
His voice has no added autotune

00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:00.000
In this year's June, his singing was shown to the 35.000 people that attended his concert at Seibu Dome

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.000
♫ Won't you dance with me? ♫

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:06.000
♫ Ripples on the water that resound with sorrow ♫

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.500
♫ In the depths of the Yellow River ♫

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:12.200
P: I really like him! I listen to his songs everyday! -

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:15.200
P: He can sing a high key that girls even sing up to -

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:18.500
P: The fact that he can make those high notes is astonishing -

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:20.000
Mafumafu-san,

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:22.000
Is actually a very shy person

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:23.000
Mafumafu in a shy tone: I'm Mafu

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:28.000
Because he doesn't show his face,

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:30.000
He keeps his mask on even when we interviewed him

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.500
What kind of artist is Mafumafu?

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:34.000
Let us uncover his charm

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:41.000
Now is when ZIP finds the hot topic influencers / Uncovering

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:46.000
Mafumafu-san started posting covers and other videos in 2010

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:48.000
His total views are over 800 million

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:54.000
It's his first time participating in a TV interview as an individual

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:55.000
M: Mafumafu, I: interviewer

00:01:55.000 --> 00:02:00.000
M: I was really nervous; I didn't sleep much last night

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.000
M: so I was really looking forward to it

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:06.000
M: My replies may not be very serious, sorry about that

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:10.000
I: What's the reason to not show your face?

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:13.000
M: Because the activities I do are all on the internet,

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:17.000
M: I'm a bit scared to overly present who I am

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:20.000
The shy Mafumafu-san,

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:25.000
One of his most prominent features being spread accross the internet is his high-toned voice

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:30.000
Singing at the same field of high notes as female singers

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:33.000
♫ A dream within a dream, or an unfullfilled dream ♫

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:37.000
♫ An orphan and a child neglected by their papa ♫

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:41.500
♫ The stars shine brighter the darker the night sky ♫

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:46.000
I: Why can your voice reach so high?

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:50.000
M: Before, I thought that I couldn't reach such a high note

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:54.000
M: Then I thought "Can I reach it?" So I tried to reach it

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:58.000
M: And then I reached it

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:04.000
Praised along with his natural high-toned voice in his original lyrics

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:09.000
M: I've continuing to learn expressions,

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:10.500
M: Even though it's a bit embarrasing to say,

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:13.000
M: But I like reading the reference books used for modern lterature

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:15.000
M: I brought a lot of books,

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:17.000
M: and I found that I couldn't understand any of it

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:19.000
M: Whether day or night, I'm learning

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:21.000
♫ Won't you dance with me? ♫

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:24.000
♫ Ripples on the water that resound with sorrow ♫

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:28.000
♫ In the depths of the Yellow River ♫

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:31.000
♫ Dreams of longing are ♫

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:34.000
♫ ephemeral bubbles from a time already past ♫

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:36.000
First of all, the vocals

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:39.000
It's really like a girl's voice

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:40.000
Because it's usually low

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:42.000
♫ For whom shall I blossom for ♫

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:45.000
He also knows how to wtite and arrange

00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:48.000
I don't think he's learned it before, stuff like writing songs

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:50.000
He's a talented person

00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:53.000
When he closed his knees with a "kyu ('Cute' in Japanese)"

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:55.500
You can tell that his personality is also pretty good

00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:00.000
Doing his live activities as well as song postings,

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:02.000
He'll continue to work hard on his music carrer
